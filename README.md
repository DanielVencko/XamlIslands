# Xaml Islands early samples repository

This repository has several Xaml Island samples to demonstrate how to use it in several scenarios. These samples are temporary meanwhile the Xaml Island v1 feature and the VS tooling are in development. There is no guarantee that these samples work for everyone. This is only for those impatient developers who want to try unfinished and unstable things, like me :) 

If you are curious about it, install 1) the latest Win10 Insider build, 2) the Windows 10 SDK, and 3) the Visual Studio 2019 Preview 2.

If you want to report a bug, that for sure you will hit one :), please, send me repo. 
If you want to give us very early feedback, tell us why this is useful or useless for you,  please send an email to xamlIslandsfeedback at microsoft dot com, my engineering team will receive it.
